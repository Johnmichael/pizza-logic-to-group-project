# Pizza Order Website

This is the week four code review for the "Intro to Programming" project for Epicodus students.

## Getting Started

This project will either be available for download immediately, or will be available on Github Pages.

After downloading, drag and drop "index.html" onto an empty Google Chrome tab.

### Prerequisites

If you can view this, then there is a incredibly likely chance that you already have all the prerequisites.

If you can not view this, or are on a mobile browser, I would suggest you accommodate the nearest desktop or laptop computer with an internet connection. For more advanced users, transfer the "Portfolio-landing-page-master" to that computer.
